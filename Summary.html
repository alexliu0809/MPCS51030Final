						This app is designed to provide basic information on overwatch, a first-person shooting game by Blizzard Entertainment. In this app we mainly have 5 functions, namely Media, Discover, Heros, Maps and My Career. In media, heros and maps, we have the same functionality like many other helper apps. We provide detail information on maps, heros that are from the game. Our featured section is discover and my career, where we put a lot of effort in it. These two sections are discussed in detail below.
						</br>
						</br>
						In this app we solve several problems for users. First, we have an api to retrieve player data, and present the data in a special way. We first show player's basic information, we then show the mostly concerned data, finally we present other data that users might be interested of. Second, we provide information that user might need to play the game. Third, we recommend suitable heros for users so that they can get familiar the game quickly

							The discover section is our featured section. We have some intersting functionalities in this section. If user doesn't know what to play today, we provide a random hero generator to generate one for user. Also, based on a simple questionaire, we can provide hero recommandation for users. Finally, if you cannot find any one to play with you, we offer the chance to publish your information and find teammates!

							My Career is also our featured section and contains many attracting elements.The app will retreive the user data from blizzard. Then we will display a detailed analysis on user's statistic, including basic user information, featured stats, most often played heros, etc. We also provide a full view of user's stats, like death, damage, etc. We are trying to provide as much information as we can to users so that they don't have to get the stats from Blizzard's offical website.
