Katya Volskaya is its CEO.\n\nIn more recent times, in light of increased aggression from the Siberian omnium, the company increased production. Shortly after Guillermo Portero stepped down as CEO of LumériCo, Volskaya experienced a security breach in its network. This was at the hands of Sombra, who was able to shut down the company's security systems as she, Widowmaker, and Reaper (all Talon operatives) conducted a raid on the company's mech factory in order to assassinate Katya. Katya survived, but numerous personnel were killed and at least one mech were destroyed.", "NEPAL" : "Nepal", "ANTARCTICA" : "Watchpoint", "DORADO" : "Mexico", "TEMPLE OF ANUBIS" : "Egypt", "OASIS" : "Iraq", "NUMBANI" : "Numbani", "ROUTE 66" : "U.S.", "GIBRALTAR" : "Watchpoint", "HANAMURA" : "Japan", "HOLLYWOOD": "U.S.", "EICHENWALDE" : "Germany", "LIJIANG TOWER" : "China", "ILIOS" : "Greek"]
