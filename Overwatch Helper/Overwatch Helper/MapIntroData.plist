		<string>Volskaya Industries is a Russian company involved in Svyatogor production. Katya Volskaya is its CEO.

In more recent times, in light of increased aggression from the Siberian omnium, the company increased production. Shortly after Guillermo Portero stepped down as CEO of LumériCo, Volskaya experienced a security breach in its network. This was at the hands of Sombra, who was able to shut down the company&apos;s security systems as she, Widowmaker, and Reaper (all Talon operatives) conducted a raid on the company&apos;s mech factory in order to assassinate Katya. Katya survived, but numerous personnel were killed and at least one mech were destroyed.</string>

		<string>Years ago, a group of omnic robots experienced what they described as a spiritual awakening. They abandoned their programmed lives to establish a monastery high in the Himalayas, where like-minded omnics could gather to meditate on the nature of their existence. Led by their spiritual leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, they took over the ruins of an ancient monastery and turned it into the home of the Shambali, a place where omnics and humans alike make pilgrimages in the hopes of finding a greater truth.</string>

		<string>Maintained by Overwatch, the ecopoint served as a monitoring station for the study of Earth&apos;s changing climate.

Disaster struck the station when it was hit by a polar storm, damaging the station&apos;s solar array. Cut off from the outside world, the scientists were left stranded in the damaged facility. As their supplies dwindled, they entered cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be made.

Rescue came years later, but Dr. Mei-Ling Zhou was the only survivor. By this point, Overwatch was no more, and the eco-watchpoints had ceased to operate.</string>

But there is a new dawn, as LumériCo and its CEO, war hero and former president Guillermo Portero, are unveiling a string of fusion plants that promise to deliver clean, free energy to the Mexican people.

The attacking team begins in Missión Dorado, a historic location famous for the sound of the ornamental bells that hang amidst its arches.</string>

While most believe that the site is of interest for archaelogical reasons, it also hides the entrance to a research facility that extends deep beneath the earth. The facility is alleged to house an artificial intelligence, but the whole truth is known only to a select few. Not even the agents of Helix Security International who guard the facility know what they&apos;re protecting.[1]</string>

		<key>description</key>
		<string>Oasis is set in the Arabian desert of Iraq. It was founded by a collective of eight leading scientists, led by Ibrahim Hassoun, Anya Al-Shahrani, Youssef al-Jabiri, and Mehmet Farhat. They were looking for a way to push the boundaries of what modern science at the time could do, albeit hindered by regulations. To that end they founded Oasis as a testament to the ingenuity of humanity. In their minds, what better way to do so than by turning a desolate landscape into one of the most technologically advanced and wondrous cities in the world, which could serve as a hub for unrestricted scientific endeavor. (The Ministry of Geology, led by Dr. Al-Shahrani, spearheaded the effort by developing cutting-edge technology that could sustain a thriving city in a desert environment.)

As per its goal for advancing human knowledge, Oasis has one of the most highly educated populations on Earth, served by a state-of-the-art university and a database of all the world&apos;s known existing printed material. It also ranks as one of the safest cities due to its usage of advanced predictive surveillance and crime modeling. Inhabitants also enjoy access to a wide range of world-class amenities, such as the verdant Abu Hassoun Gardens, temperature controlled streets, the luxurious Gilded Tower Hotel, and the elBuffi restaurant, considered the best dining establishment in the world. Perhaps the only cause for concern is the growing city&apos;s heavy traffic, for which the Ministry of Transportation has issued a public advisory. One of Oasis&apos; most recognizable landmarks is an enigmatic tower that remains under construction for an indefinite period of time. Already the world&apos;s tallest building, it is slated to become the tallest freestanding structure of any kind. It is believed that the project is part of the city&apos;s ever-expanding computational and data collecting efforts.

The Vishkar Corporation desires to have a presence in the city.</string>

		<string>One of the world&apos;s most peaceful and foremost centers of scientific discovery and exploration, Numbani is an utopian city on the edge of the African savanna, somewhere near Nigeria. Called the City of Harmony, omnic-human equality is at the core of Numbani. Omnics and humans built Numbani together, and their mutual cooperation is the driving force behind Numbani&apos;s success. It celebrates an event called &quot;Unity Day&quot;.

At some point after the Omnic Crisis, it was identified as an area with an active threat. It is currently under threat by Doomfist. To defend itself against those that would see the omnic-human relationship harmed and to defend against Doomfist, the citizens of Numbani developed the OR15 defense robot.


Atlas News report on Numbani airport attack
At some point after Overwatch&apos;s recall, the Numbani airport was attacked by Doomfist who destroyed several OR15 defense robots. As a result, flights in and out of Numbani were suspended. Doomfist&apos;s gauntlet was also stolen.</string>

The gas stations, roadside shops, and cafes have gone into disuse, and the fabled Deadlock Gorge is mostly seen from the comfort of transcontinental train cars. But amid the fading monuments of that earlier era, the outlaws of the Deadlock Gang are planning their biggest heist yet.</string>

The base was shut down, but the base showed signs of activity in recent times. This was from Winston, who as part of his intent to reform Overwatch, intended to bring the group&apos;s communication network back online. Constructing a satellite drone, he needed to get it to a rocket. The drone was successfully launched, and he looked on with pride.</string>

		<string>Hanamura is a well-preserved village of unassuming shops and quiet streets, known mostly for its idyllic cherry blossom festival every spring. But to those who know its history, Hanamura is the ancestral home of the Shimada ninja clan, which had grown over the centuries to become a powerful criminal organization. As its neighboring cities expanded, Hanamura was encircled, and eventually it was incorporated as a district within a larger city. For now, the imposing compound of the Shimada family lies empty, but that peace may soon be broken.</string>

The town was the site of one of the most famous battles during the Omnic Crisis. It was here that the leader of the Crusaders, Balderich von Adler, and a handful of his best soldiers made a last stand against an advancing automaton army. Outnumbered and outgunned, they were ultimately slain during the resulting combat. However, thanks to their valiant efforts, the German military was able to push back the omnic offensive and win the fight. In the present day, Eichenwalde lies abandoned, and the forest has slowly begun overtaking the village. However, the scars of war will never completely fade.</string>

Situated atop a small island rising from the Aegean Sea, Ilios is a postcard-perfect Mediterranean town, with a bustling harborside, winding paths for rambling hillside strolls, and gorgeous vistas. It is the ideal vacation stop for people looking for a place to relax, or for those interested in exploring the ruins scattered at the top of the island, where many artifacts and relics of the ancient world have been recently unearthed. The ruins were declared an internationally protected heritage site. However, Talon attempted to steal the artifacts.</string>
